/**
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
 * <p>
 * Symbol       Value
 * I             1
 * V             5
 * X             10
 * L             50
 * C             100
 * D             500
 * M             1000
 * For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together.
 * Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 * <p>
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However,
 * the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV.
 * Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
 * The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 * <p>
 * I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
 * X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
 * C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 * Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
