/**
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0).
 * Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
 * using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
 * <p>
 * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.
 * The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.
